### Partioning

The easiest and simplest method is to use GParted, which is a graphical partition manager.
GParted is not installed by default, but it is available in the Ubuntu software repositories;
see Chapter 9, "Managing Software," if you need help installing it.

In addition to being useful for adding drives, GParted can also assist you in recovering
from problems. You can run it after booting Ubuntu in a live session or running from a
live CD or a USB drive.

# Shutting down Using the Command Line

```
sudo shutdown -h now
```
